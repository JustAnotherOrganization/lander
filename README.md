# Lander

The landing page manager for JAO

## Go Vanity

This application lets you use `justanother.org` as a vanity url. While this can
make using our public source code a tad bit more annoying to use (who even uses
it lol), it has mainly been done so our internal source code is cleaner. 

This means 
that instead of running...

```
go get github.com/justanotherorganization/lander
```

You would run...

```
go get justanother.org/lander
```

This shortens the url from 41ish characters to just 22. How convenient :D
